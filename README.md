## Overview

The project uses Java's `javax.swing` GUI library to create and render an
application window. This allows the application to be platform independent,
lightweight, and with swappable look and feel.

The individual shapes are children of abstract shape objects, and the
application demonstrates both inheritance and object utilization, as each
individual brush stroke or object is an individual object itself.
